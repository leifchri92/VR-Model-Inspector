In VR, transform gizmos aren't drawing
	- get distance multiplier is working fine

Bugs
--------------------------------
* origin isn't right on all models for transform
* transform outline isn't correct size
* models aren't placed correctly
* overlapping buttons are triggered 
* gizmo resizes with head turn

[X] toggle to switch between models and lights
[X] combine lights and models panel into scene panel
[X] Add light
[X] Change light properties
[X] Deselect model Properties
[X] Add model
[X] Select model to add
[X] Scale model
[X] Scale scale with model
[X] Fix transform gizmo
	[X] render
	[X] deselection
	[X] sensitivity
[ ] Grabbable everything
[ ] Make github page

Transform
* allow user to set default transform to return to

PropertiesChanger
* if transformable
    - if has light component -> change light properties
    - else if has mesh -> change material properties

VR Inspector

* Cannot submit assets to asset store that contain other assets

* select object
	- set a scale
		select measure start
		select measure end
		give value
	x transform
		rotate
		scale
		translate
		copy transform/mirror transform to another object
	- material
		x matcap
		shaded texture
		shadeless texture

* disable individual scale axes
* scale with joystick, push up and down
    - only uniform
* have option to show meter stick
* don't show scale gizmo
* center translate gizmo
* center rotate
* toggle between transform values using controller button or joy stick
* click add model and then get a list of names
* menu can be grabbed and positioned in space
* try with menu 1m by 1m

--------------------------
[X] Add menu on ground
[ ] Add buttons
	[X] transform
	[X] add light
	[ ] Materials
	[X] Add statue
		- scale to be 1 meter
	[ ] Set statue scale
[ ] Read matt paper

* how to visualize lights? All the time? Just when editting?
* need to make it so that transformGizmo only acts on certain objects
* going to have to add light controls
* started material
	- make canvas that autopopulates with swatches for the materials
	- instantiate or enable/disable canvas and place next to selected object

Still ToDo
[ ] Fix outline shader
[ ] Better way to visualize lights
[ ] Turn on and off elements properly
	- only show light box when editing
[ ] Rename VRInspector to main canvas manager
[ ] UI for materials
	- slider with buttons, animate slide
[ ] Visualize light area?
