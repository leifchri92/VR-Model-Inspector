--------------------------
[X] Add menu on ground
[ ] Add buttons
	[X] transform
	[X] add light
	[ ] Materials
	[X] Add statue
		- scale to be 1 meter
	[ ] Set statue scale
[ ] Read matt paper

* how to visualize lights? All the time? Just when editting?
* need to make it so that transformGizmo only acts on certain objects
* going to have to add light controls
* started material
	- make canvas that autopopulates with swatches for the materials
	- instantiate or enable/disable canvas and place next to selected object

Still ToDo
[ ] Fix outline shader
[ ] Better way to visualize lights
[ ] Turn on and off elements properly
	- only show light box when editing
[ ] Rename VRInspector to main canvas manager
[ ] UI for materials
	- slider with buttons, animate slide
[ ] Visualize light area?
